Q. swap the elements of the array which have atlest distance k wiht each other

Problem - swapping it not a big deal but intutition is that we have to keep track of those elments which can be swapped as 
two ele can only be swapped when they have atleast k distance . 

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	// your code goes here
	int t;
	cin>>t;
	while(t--){
	    int n,k;
	    cin>>n>>k ;
	    vector<int>a(n),v,p ;
	    
	    for( int i=0; i<n; i++ ){
	        cin>>a[i]; 

         // keeping indexes and values which are k dis apart and ele after k dist would have ele to be swapped.
	        if( n-1-i >= k || i >= k )
	         p.push_back(i), v.push_back(a[i]) ;
	    }

     // to lexically smallest 
	    sort(v.begin(), v.end());
	    
	    for( int j=0; j<p.size(); j++ ){
	        a[p[j]] = v[j] ;
	    }
	    
	    for( int i=0; i<n; i++ ){
	        cout<< a[i] << " ";
	    }
	    cout<<endl;
	}
	return 0;
}
